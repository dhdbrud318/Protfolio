          <p>
            Security has always been a big concern in today’s society. The
            primary goal is to provide cost-saving AI software solutions to
            fulfill users’ needs regarding the concern of not only security, but
            also vehicles and other issues. In order to achieve this goal, we
            will focus on combining the features of Kneron’s previous products
            into one single solution, making it more efficient and
            cost-effective.

          <h2 class="fs-400 fw-500 text-purple">Statement of Work</h2>
          <p>
            Our overall quantitative goal is to develop a smartphone app using
            machine learning technology that will identify whether a person
            entering home has entry access and then either deny or grant entry.
            The application will be a byproduct of fusing their pre-existing
            tailgating and face recognition applications which will be
            integrated to a home assistant and control multiple devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given Kneron’s APIs, app components, and data architecture, our team
            is to integrate their backend into an application for IOS and
            android. The frontend will be built from scratch to complement the
            integrated backend, and as long as it meets Kneron’s standard our
            team is given full jurisdiction over its development.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kneron backend will use their Kneron cloud, several of their
            APIs, and other provided applications. Kneron requests that the
            frontend will be developed primarily on android studio and the
            backend on linux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the quantitative goal, there is a qualitative focus. Kneron
            desires that this project serve as a keystone example to inspire
            future development of fused applications using their marketplace’s
            component apps.

            The diagram above describes all the states that our proposed system
            will have. Based upon the system’s main features and functions, the
            diagram is divided into 4 parts; Login, Manage Authorized Users, Log
            Check, and Activity Recognition and Update, respectively. Every part
            interacts with each other within the system, as described in the
            bridges between boxes. They could be in a certain relationship, for
            example, the login process is the prerequisite for the user
            authorization step.
          </p>
          <p>
            The term “state” refers to a visual representation that depicts the
            interaction between the UI components based on user actions. The
            block boxes indicate the User Interfaces, such as the Login and
            Homepage, and the arrows connected to each UI show possible user
            scenarios and their following outcomes, especially for how the
            system reacts towards each user input type. The boxes with an “X”
            mark at the top left corner represent event handlers, in this case,
            either confirmation or warning, that prompts users’ certain
            attention or awareness in terms of error prevention and recovery.
